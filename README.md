# Web Dev Portfolio

## Description

This repo contains my web developer portfolio and displays detailed sections:
- about me (featuring my pets!)
- my work
- and how to contact me.

Further details: the webpage layout is responsive using flexbox technique. Some images were edited for a more cohesive color theme.

## Usage

You can use the navigation bar at the top-right of the webpage for quick access to each section. The images in the work and contact sections are respectively linked to my deployed applications, GitHub, and LinkedIn.
